summary: Content uniformity is a key quality characteristics for drug products, and the existing ASTM standard E2810 provides a very conservative acceptance limits based on a two-stage test. We obtain improved acceptance limits by using a Bayesian approach that focuses on the posterior distribution of the probability of passing the UDU test.<br/><br/>Lewis R. A. and Fan A.
