# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Due to a growing number of prognostic factors for each individual and specifically targeted treatments, precision medicine draws attentions for customization of therapies and medical decisions for individual patient. Variables that are vital for medical decision making may be neglected by traditional techniques targeting on prediction, and new methods need to be developed to identify relevant covariates for dynamic decision making. <br/><br/>Shi C., Fan A., Song R., and Lu W.
