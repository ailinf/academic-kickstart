summary: While machine learning techniques are enjoying rapid adoption by many companies, there are many common pitfalls in designing ML system in real-world deployments. We develop an ML system tailored to practical ML workflows for financial services named Hyperion. This system is a family of libraries built in-house with the goal of facilitating data science practices in financial services.<br/><br/>Fan A., Sun S., Pappu V., Zhu J., Yedida N., Li D., Yang R., and Lapham M.
